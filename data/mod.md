Foreword

Defence of the nation is the first duty of government. In an age of constant competition, we need to maintain a robust evidence base to help us get the most out of the defence budget. Finding out whether our investments and policy decisions have been effective, delivered value for money, and are achieving anticipated outcomes is an essential part of maintaining and developing that evidence base. As a professional and learning organisation, the Ministry of Defence is committed to understanding what we do well and where we should aspire to do better. This is a fundamental part of delivering an effective defence for the nation. I am therefore pleased to introduce this strategy, which is part of a wider set of activities to enhance our approach to evaluation. The strategy sets our direction moving forward, and outlines where we aspire to be in the future. It is intended to provide greater assurance and accountability that, in times of constrained resources, the department is making the right decisions and is maximising the impacts of its spending.

David Williams, Permanent Secretary

# Executive Summary

The Ministry of Defence Evaluation Strategy is being launched to guide policy and programme evaluation activity in the department and to demonstrate a public commitment to undertaking high-quality evaluation.

The strategy sets out how the department will meet the objectives of improving the quantity, quality, and impact of policy and programme evaluations over the next three years and ensuring that quality evaluation evidence is actively used in decision making.

To achieve these aims MoD are delivering against the following strategic pillars that have proved effective in other government departments:

- Incorporating the requirement for evaluation into existing corporate governance frameworks for decision making.
- Developing a proportionate forward plan of evaluation reports to be reviewed by the Defence Board and its sub-committees and which can be used as evidence for accountability bodies.
- Creating a culture of evaluation within the Ministry of Defence so that information on performance is deliberately sought out to learn how to improve policy and programme delivery in defence.

To embed these changes, the department has established a multidisciplinary evaluation team within the Analysis Directorate and employed evaluation professionals within key programmes and policy areas who operate together in a ‘Community of Practice’ following the principles and guidance in the HMT Magenta Book.

Evaluation is seamlessly integrated into the ROAMEF cycle and other existing processes, such as IPA reviews. Evaluation both complements and benefits from these other processes.

The strategy will take time to implement and progress will be reviewed annually. We plan to have fully embedded these changes by December 2024.

# Introduction

1.1. The Integrated Review has increased the need for an improved evaluation capability in defence. Our aim is for quality evaluation evidence to become embedded into the existing governance frameworks for decision making.

1.2. The objective is for the Ministry of Defence to be using systematic and consistent evaluations to better inform evidence-based decision making. This will ensure that lessons are systematically being learned from past performance and objective data is being routinely collected to inform the department about its activities and how to better ensure their success.

1.3. To achieve our goals, the department is following the three-pillared strategy of: (i) explicitly linking evaluation to existing governance frameworks for decision making; (ii) developing a proportionate forward plan of evaluations to be seen by the Defence Board; and (iii) creating a culture of evaluation within the department. We have established a central evaluation team within the Analysis Directorate, employed evaluation professionals to key programmes, and are expanding the use of evaluation methods through a growing Community of Practice.

# Scope

1.4. The scope of this strategy covers programme and policy evaluation: specifically, (i) evaluation of projects and programmes that are subject to MOD approval processes; (ii) evaluation of policies most critical to delivering the priority outcomes set out in the Outcome Delivery Plan.

# Objectives

1.5. The Ministry of Defence will:

- Improve the quantity, quality, and impact of policy, programme, and project evaluation.
- Guarantee that evaluation is used to make sure that lessons are truly learned and evidence around performance against objectives exists to support accountability processes.

# Incorporating Evaluation into Governance

2.1. An important first step is to embed the requirement for monitoring and evaluation into the framework for corporate governance and approvals so that it becomes part of key decision-making processes.

2.2. Ministry of Defence Director General Finance has agreed to champion evaluation by:

- Formally stating that the Investment Approval Committee will demand that all projects have central evaluation team-endorsed evaluation plans alongside every business case submission.
- Requiring that any new business case (in particular Strategic Outline Cases) or review notes must reference existing evaluation evidence to inform spending decisions.

2.3. The central evaluation team are working with Front Line Commands to embed evaluation requirements for projects and programmes that are approved within the commands. In doing so, we are applying templates and guidance aligned to the Magenta Book to ensure a high-quality, consistent, and proportionate approach. We are aware of comments highlighting similar work such as IPA reviews, but there are distinct differences and benefits from carrying out an evaluation over an IPA review.

2.4. The Ministry of Defence uses performance metrics to measure progress against departmental outcomes and inform evidence-based strategic decision making. Working with the Cabinet Office, we are strengthening our policy evaluation capability and adopting best practices from those in the centre of government responsible for overseeing and evaluating the implementation of the Integrated Review.

# Establishing a Proportionate Evaluation Programme

3.1. It would not be cost-effective to try to evaluate every project and programme. The central evaluation team has therefore developed a prioritised forward plan for programme evaluations to be reviewed by Defence Board and its sub-committees, and which can be provided as evidence to accountability bodies. The prioritised forward plan is in Annex A.

3.2. The following principles have been applied to prioritise the forward plan:

- The intervention’s strategic importance;
- Its financial value;
- Interventions in response to statutory obligations;
- The risk and uncertainty surrounding project outcomes of an intervention; and
- Whether the evaluation will be of use to either the project or policy team and/or the department.

3.3. At present, this forward plan outlines intended evaluation activity for MOD centrally approved business cases. Work to enhance the evaluation of priority outcomes within the Outcome Delivery Plan is ongoing and is intended to be embedded in future iterations of the plan as appropriate.

# 4. Embedding a Culture of Evaluation

4.1. Key to the strategy’s success is the need to create a learning culture to understand what works, for whom, and in what context, and use this knowledge to advance understanding and decision making.

4.2. A core activity is to build awareness of what evaluation is and is not. This is being achieved through outreach at conferences and presentations to individual policy and programme delivery areas, and is supported by broadcasts from senior leaders championing and promoting the importance of evaluation.

4.3. We have developed a community of practice for evaluation practitioners in defence to share best practice and coordinate evaluation activity within the department.

4.4. In the future, we will develop and deliver targeted training packages that bring evaluation to life in a defence context, focusing on fundamentals of evaluation to ensure that relevant tools and methodology can be applied in day-to-day work.

# Annex A – Forward Programme

MOD is committed to publishing programme evaluations to the public on Gov.uk in accordance with Government Social Research publication protocol. In cases where evaluations are unsuitable for release into the public domain (due to commercial and national security considerations), they will not be published publicly. These evaluations are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (2000) under Section 43 (Commercial) and Section 26 (National Security).

Pre-Full Business Case Project Evaluation

Prioritised programmes where key projects are expected to submit a Full Business Case in the next three years. These will provide lessons for other programmes and decision makers about the design of programmes and the route to Full Business Case Approval.
